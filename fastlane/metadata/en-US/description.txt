"Usbong" is a social business whose mission is to defeat poverty by uplifting human lives through our thrusts in education and healthcare. Our vision is to build a community where there is lasting peace.

We provide training and workshops on mobile development, and we offer software development services, such that as long as you have a flowchart, we can turn it into an app. 

Our flagship open source product is also called "Usbong." Together with its companion app, "Usbong Builder," they help even non-technical people build their own mobile apps for use in data collection, assessment, training, screening, diagnostics, and also multilingual interactive digital storytelling.
